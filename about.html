            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>We started with a simple goal: to bring joy through food. Our chefs put their heart into every dish.<br>
                Our Founder and Co.Founder are winners of the famous Cooking competion. They have won many awards for their cooking skills.
                As they both were good friends they decided to open a restaurant together. They both have a passion for cooking and serving people.
                They both have a dream to open a restaurant where people can come and enjoy the food with their family and friends.
